# Christchurch Philatelic Foundation CMS

History is a significant component in every civilisation, if written, could tell how people lived, what governing systems and technology was used. However If not written, like other civilisation in society, it gets manipulated, twisted by people who look down on other civilisations, to make them a superior race. Reminding The Past is a Content Management System(CMS) web app developed for Christchurch Philatelic Foundation. It allows them to add, edit, delete post.
